Here I come, get out of my way
Better lock the doors, you all
Good time's over now
Mr. "Nice Guy" left the hall

I spent a life in misbelief
Trusted everyone
Those days are over by now

Cause I'm
Bad to the bone
Bad, bad, bad
Bad to the bone
Yes I am...

I've been used, got confused
And paid for most of all
Then left outside alone
With my back against the wall

Cheaters, cons and profiteers
Companions all my life
Ain't gonna take it no more

Now I'm
Bad to the bone
Bad, bad, bad
Bad to the bone...
Oh yeah!

(B part)
I'm not asking for salvation
Just don't want to play your game
Of "hit n' run" again
Grab the most you can
Don't even try, gimme no lie
The damage is done, get on your knees and pray...

There's a time for all...
Don't you dare to come my way...
Now you should, take a good advice
'Cuz you know you gonna get my surprise...

[00:25.32] Now the day I was born
[00:27.26] The nurses all gathered 'round
[00:29.68] And they gazed in wide wonder
[00:31.85] At the joy they had found
[00:34.46] The head nurse spoke up
[00:36.60] Said, "Leave this one alone"
[00:39.27] She could tell right away
[00:41.44] That I was bad to the bone
[00:54.44] 
[00:43.80] Bad to the bone
[00:45.98] Bad to the bone
[00:48.65] B-B-B-B-Bad
[00:51.03] B-B-B-B-Bad
[00:53.60] B-B-B-B-Bad
[00:59.10] 
[00:56.35] Bad to the bone
[01:03.85] 
[00:58.71] I broke a thousand hearts
[01:00.68] Before I met you
[01:03.52] I'll break a thousand more, baby
[01:05.66] Before I am through
[01:08.08] I wanna be yours pretty baby
[01:10.59] Yours and yours alone
[01:13.17] I'm here to tell ya honey
[01:15.50] That I'm bad to the bone
[01:17.93] Bad to the bone
[01:20.61] B-B-B-Bad
[01:22.51] B-B-B-Bad
[01:27.01] 
[01:25.49] B-B-B-Bad
[01:27.81] Bad to the bone
[01:35.31] 
[02:02.55] I make a rich woman beg
[02:05.46] I'll make a good woman steal
[02:07.65] I'll make an old woman blush
[02:09.76] And make a young girl squeal
[02:12.19] I wanna be yours pretty baby
[02:14.32] Yours and yours alone
[02:16.93] I'm here to tell ya honey
[02:18.83] That I'm bad to the bone
[02:30.83] 
[02:21.59] B-B-B-B-Bad
[02:23.93] B-B-B-B-Bad
[02:26.30] B-B-B-B-Bad
[02:31.80] 
[02:28.93] Bad to the bone
[02:36.43] 
[03:45.04] And when I walk the streets
[03:49.39] Kings and Queens step aside
[03:52.27] Every woman I meet
[03:54.15] They all stay satisfied
[03:57.09] I wanna tell ya pretty baby
[03:59.44] Well ya see I make my own
[04:01.67] I'm here to tell ya honey
[04:03.56] That I'm bad to the bone
[04:06.15] Bad to the bone
[04:08.53] B-B-B-B-Bad
[04:10.96] B-B-B-Bad
[04:13.65] B-B-B-Bad
[04:15.70] Bad to the bone
